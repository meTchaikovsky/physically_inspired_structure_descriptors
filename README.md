This package was developed in the work "Accurate structural descriptor enabled screening for nitrogen and oxygen vacancy codoped TiO2 with a large bandgap narrowing" by Zhang Kangyu. The package was designed only to construct structure descriptors for N/Vo-codoped anatase TiO2.

find_vecs.py is the example script to build structure descriptors.
